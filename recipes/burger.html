    <h3>Need a basic burger recipe that you can whip up in no time? </h3>

    <p>We have the perfect one. With just 5 ingredients and 15 minutes of cooking time</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon of grounded black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound of ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Steps</h5>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate</li>
        
        <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
        
        <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
